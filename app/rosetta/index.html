    <p>As the world’s best-selling commercial language-learning software, Rosetta Stone has been teaching the world to speak new languages for almost twenty years. Using immersive learning as opposed to the old textbook method, the software has been awarded educational and learning awards since its initial release and is widely considered the gold standard for language software. Starting as a box set of CDs with software, Rosetta Stone is pushing forward into a new age with online learning subscriptions and native application software to help teach a new generation. With this push, they were looking for new ways to engage the younger, more smartphone-friendly demographic via a mobile website design that used engaging interactions, videos, and live demos to show insights into Rosetta Stone and make them stand head and shoulders above the competition.</p>

    <h2>Initial Concept</h2>

    <p>The main idea behind the new mobile site was getting away from the old “yellow box CD-ROM” company that many people knew and show the full story of a future-looking learn-anywhere software service. They had acquired other language companies, rolled out new products and services, and were available on mobile and tablet devices from anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, the site concept was built around the idea of using interactions and gestures as an engagement feature, not simply as a way to navigate. Incorporating immersive images and videos allowed the site to serve rich, interactive storytelling on the go (as well as act as a destination for those looking to purchase the software). These features needed to target the two types of users visiting the site: the one wanting to learn more about the product on their phone and the potential buyer just trying to jump right in and purchase.</p>

    <p>From the beginning of the concept phase, we viewed working with Rosetta Stone as an exploration of creative options with a partner, not a client. We used a more iterative and idea-driven process – brainstorms, napkin sketches, rough wireframes, paper prototypes – as a way to reach the goals of the content requirements and creative brief without getting bogged down too deep in design or building. This allowed us to flesh out the overall interactive strategy just as much as the design and development as we continued working on the site.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>Since the site would be pushing Rosetta Stone forward into the future, the design worked to bring in more of the brand’s vibrant identity. Using brand oranges, blues, and grays, as well as textures and patterns, the site clearly communicated that it was part of the Rosetta Stone family without overwhelming them with the “yellow box.” Using large, bright hero images throughout the design served as an emotional narrative for users to connect with as they browsed and inspired them to delve deeper into the site. In this same vein, we opened the design up so it was less contained, allowing the information to flow easily and understandably without boxing everything inside a tight grid.</p>

    <p>Even though it’s a mobile site, we wanted to stay away from any ideas of “tabbed” navigation (a standard on iOS native applications). Instead, we used an unobtrusive sticky menu at the top of the page that stayed with users throughout their scrolling so that they could easily access any page. With the goal of featuring the products and their features and inspiring users to explore content, horizontal swiping within sections became a secondary form of navigation. Utilizing the full features of a touch device, users were able to simply swipe across a section or hero image to dive deeper into the content and features associated with it.</p>

<section id="rosetta_develop" class="padded-horizontal padded-vertical development">
    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>We approached development with the intention to bust the myth that users don’t want full access and functionality of a desktop site – they want to be able to do the same things and the full experience, just optimized for a mobile interface and data speeds. Our goal was thus to keep each page load smaller than one megabyte and have pages load in less than five seconds each, so that those with cellular connections would still be able to easily and quickly explore the site. We also wanted to avoid replicating native functionality built into mobile browsers (as they tend to take up valuable screen real estate), so didn’t try to fit “back” buttons into the design.</p>

    <p>An interesting development dilemma arose when the site was launching: the impending release of iOS 7. With the updated operating system across iPhones, the native web browser implemented an edge-swipe gesture that acted as a forward/back history navigation function. With the wide variety of smartphones and mobile browsers out there, it was certainly not a dealbreaker, but an interesting conundrum. Do we remove the functionality entirely? Change the whole explorative nature of the gesture? In the end, we decided to keep the horizontal swiping in place, while doubling down on the functionality and usefulness of the top sticky navigation to ensure that all users were able to access and interact with the entire site.</p>

    <h2>The Shopping Cart</h2>

    <p>One of the biggest ideas we wanted to introduce with the new mobile site was an efficient and intuitive shopping cart for users. We conducted extensive user research and multiple design iterations with the goal to reduce time to checkout and make the entire process easy to navigate and complete.</p>

    <p>With the introduction of the new Rosetta Stone products, the initial hurdle was showing the difference between the actual products: the CD-ROM software vs Totale (the online subscription service with app component). Illustrating their features and end value to the user at an initial phase was crucial to them understanding what they were actually purchasing.</p>

    <p>The next question that arose was whether customers picked their language or their product first. User testing showed that users often thought that different languages had different products, complicating the purchase. With that in mind, the checkout process was approached from a product-first approach, having customers pick the product before choosing their language, essentially equating the language choice with choosing the color of your new shirt while shopping.</p>

    <p>The final problem to solve was the language of the shopping cart itself. Using “Buy Now” language as a call to action intimidated shoppers and made them think that they were skipping right to checkout, as opposed to simply adding it to their shopping cart. Simply changing that language to “Shop Now” encouraged customers to use the call to action, add products to their carts, and check out.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The 2013 Beercamp site launched in full multiplayer form at the actual event in Austin, immediately drawing rave reviews from attendees. With everything in place (including a full custom soundtrack courtesy of The Grey Area), the game had hundreds of repeat visits even after the event was over.</p>

    <p>From a technical perspective, the game was a huge success. Using Node’s multi-threading and optimized information flow allowed users to play without worrying about crashing, and the improved “bouncer queue” kept the servers running flawlessly. Design-wise, users lauded the unique illustrated humorous style throughout the game, especially as you progressed through the levels.</p>

    <p>Using an agile and iterative design and development environment allowed us to work towards a minimum viable product then refine, refine, refine until everything was perfect. During refinements, we were able to cut unnecessary features that took away from the overall user experience as well as tweak things to meet user expectations.</p>

    <p>Every member of the company contributed to the project, showing a true representation of everything nclud is about and what we do. Now, why don’t you go enjoy a beer or two?</p>
