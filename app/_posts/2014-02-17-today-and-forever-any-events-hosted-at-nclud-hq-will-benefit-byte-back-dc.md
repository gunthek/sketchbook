Starting today, February 24, 2014, nclud will ask that all event organizers seeking to use our space for pubic or private events make a donation to the local non-profit <a href="http://byteback.org" target="_blank" />Byte Back<a/>. We strongly reccomend that organizers make a minimum donation of $500 or choose an amount that better reflects their abililty to give to this great cause. 

Alternatively, event organizers can choose to run a ticketing structure that allows attendees to set their own donation amount at the time of registering. This was done during the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/capitolhop-launch-party-tickets-10153803299?aff=eorg" target="_blank" />Capitol Hop Launch Party<a/> back in January and as a result DCTECH raised over $1,000 to help low-income residents of Washington DC get access to computer training and employment readiness skills.

We at nclud believe that DCTECH should be more than just a group of companies and individuals building a tech economy to benefit ourselves. We should embrace the mission of Byte Back and ensure that all of our neighbors in each and every ward, have access to the tools, technology and training necessary to particpiate and add to the sucess we have all shared in the DCTECH community.

It's easy to participate in this model of giving, just register for any public event taking place at nclud or step up to program your own event and be the reason your neighbor is able to join the modern workforce. Where would each of us be without that first introduction to the digital world? It's impossible to know, but we can all agree that we're better because of it and DCTECH will be better the more we support Byte Back.
