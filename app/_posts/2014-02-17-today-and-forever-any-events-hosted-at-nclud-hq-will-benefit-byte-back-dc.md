Starting today, February 24, 2014, nclud will ask that all event organizers seeking to use our space for pubic or private events make a donation to the local non-profit ByteBack. We strongly reccomend that organizers make a minimum donation of $500 or choose an amount that better reflects their abililty to give to this great cause. 

Alternatively, event organizers can choose to run a ticketing structure that allows attendees to set their own donation amount at the time of registering. This was done during the Capitol Hop lauch Party back in January and as a result Capitol Hop and DCTECH were able to raise over $1,000 to help low-income residents of Washington DC get access to computer training and employment readiness skills.

We at nclud believe that DCTECH should be more than just a group of companies and individuals building a tech economy to benefit ourelves and out peers. We should embrace the mission of Byte Back to ensure that all of neighbors in each and every ward, have access to the tools, technology and training necessary to particpiate and add to the sucess we have all shared in the DCTECH community.

It's easy to participate in this model of giving, just register for any public event taking place at nclud or step up to program your own event and be the reason your neighbor is able to join the modern workforce. Where would each of us be without that first introduction to digital world? It's impossible to know, but we can all agree that we're better because it and DCTECH will be better when more of us adopt this mission of giving.
