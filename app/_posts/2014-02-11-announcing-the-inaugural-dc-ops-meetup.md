Hello DC!

It gives me great pleasure to announce the first ever DC Ops Meetup hosted at nclud and open to any and all people interested in learning from one another about how to operate a small to medium size business. Yes... "How to operate a business" is a broad topic, but each event will focus on specific aspects of business operations so you can come prepared to contribute and ask questions so you can make the most of your time.

**Who started DC Ops Meetup?**
Well, I started it, <a href="https://twittermintue.com/joecorbett" target="_blank" />@joecorbett</a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://sketchbook.nclud.com/joe-corbett/" target="_blank"/>the COO of nclud</a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2013/12/09/joe-corbett-thinks-hes-finally-found-his-fit-at-nclud/" target="_blank" />that guys little brother</a>.

**Why did you start DC Ops Meetup?**
The reason I started DC Ops Meetup is rather simple. Wanting to be the best COO and all-around "ops guy" I can be I decided I needed to meet more COOs so I could more readily draw on them for adivce and guidance. I figured instead of working to expand my personal network :::barf::: I'd start a meetup where operations people could meet and learn from each other.

Where do I go to become a member DC Ops Meetup
