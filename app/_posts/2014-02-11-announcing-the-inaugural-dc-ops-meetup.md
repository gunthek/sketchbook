Hello DC!

It gives me great pleasure to announce the first ever DC Ops Meetup hosted at nclud and open to any and all people interested in learning from one another about how to operate a small to medium size business. Yes... "How to operate a business" is a broad topic, but each event will focus on specific aspects of business operations so you can come prepared to contribute and ask questions.

**Who started DC Ops Meetup?**
Well, I started it, <a href="https://twittermintue.com/joecorbett" target="_blank" />@joecorbett</a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://sketchbook.nclud.com/joe-corbett/" target="_blank"/>the COO of nclud</a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2013/12/09/joe-corbett-thinks-hes-finally-found-his-fit-at-nclud/" target="_blank" />that guys little brother</a>.

**Why did you start DC Ops Meetup?**
The reason I started DC Ops Meetup is rather simple. Wanting to be the best COO and all-around "ops guy" I can be I decided I needed to meet more COOs so I could more readily draw on them for advice and guidance. I figured instead of working to expand my personal network _:::barf:::_ I'd start a meetup where operations people could meet and learn from each other.

**Who should attend the DC Ops Meetup?**
Anyone intereted in learning how to operate small to medium business and/or anyone that already knows a lot about doing just that. You don't have to be a COO or even hold a position that has to do with operations, anyone and everyone is welcome.

**Where do I go to become a member of DC Ops Meetup?**
You'd head on over to the Meetup.com DC Ops group.

**Why is this a paid event?**
Recently nclud announced an initiaivate to use our office space to raise money for ByteBack DC. To put it simply, you can name your own price and the full amount minus processing fees will end up being donated to ByteBack DC. You can read the full annoucement here.
